        "2. H1 = $X \\cdot W1$ + b1, Z1 = $\\sigma$(H1), where $\\sigma$ is your activation function, $\\cdot$ is your hardamard product, H denotes pre-activation and Z denotes post-activation.\n",
        "3. Recursively construct your NN, H2 = (Z1 $\\cdot$W2) + b2, Z2 = $\\sigma$(H2) and final output layer is H3 = (Z2 $\\cdot$ W3) + b3, z3 = $σ^1$(H3), where $σ^1$ is your softmax function\n",
        "4. Normalize your data within 0-1 range, create one-hot encoding for your labels.\n",
        "5. Take 3digit of your first name, and convert them based on character indices - For example: Ank ---> 1 14 11, so my seed is 11411. This will ensure each students have unique seeds.\n",
        "6. Run your experiments for minimum $10$ epochs. Remember one epoch is entire pass through data.\n",
        "7. You will run each experiment min $5$ times and report your average accuracy and standard error -- Change seed per trial\n",
        "8. We have provided 2 folders, members of Teams A - E will work on data that says Team_red and Team F- K will work on data that says Team_blue\n",
        "9. Important: All parameter optimization should be done on Validation/Dev Set, you will only do one pass inference over test set.\n",
        "10. Complete all code blocks highlighted as TODO\n",
        "11. Sumbit your code, your report with findings and upload on canvas."
