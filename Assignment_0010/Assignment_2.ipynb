        "2. Test your model on same set of datasets provided in your prior assignment such as MNIST and F-MNIST/K-MNIST\n",
        "2. No - Plagarism. If solutions match, then the student who shared the solution and students who copied will be reported to USF and will get F in this course.\n",

        " \n",
        "1. Now you will Create a 4 layer Neural Network, (W1, W2, W3, W4)\n",
        "2. H1 = $X \\cdot W1$ + b1, Z1 = $\\sigma$(H1), where $\\sigma$ is your activation function, $\\cdot$ is your hardamard product, H denotes pre-activation and Z denotes post-activation.\n",
        "3. Recursively construct your NN, H2 = (Z1 $\\cdot$W2) + b2, Z2 = $\\sigma$(H2), H3 = (Z2 $\\cdot$ W3) + b3, z3 = $σ$(H3) and final output layer is H4 = (Z3 $\\cdot$ W4) + b4, z3 = $σ^1$(H4), where $σ^1$ is your softmax function.\n",
        "4. The objective function that you have used in your prior assignment is termed as cross-entropy, denoted as follows J($\\theta$) = $-{(y\\log(p) + (1 - y)\\log(1 - p))}$ for binary classification, whereas for multi-class classification we denote it as J($\\theta$) = $-\\sum_{c=1}^My_{o,c}\\log(p_{o,c})$, where M - number of classes, log - the natural log, y - binary indicator (0 or 1) if class label c is the correct classification for observation o and finally p - predicted probability observation o is of class c.\n",
        "5. Now in this assignment you will be using 2 regularizer L1 and L2 and will modify above equation as follows: For L1 J($θ$)_1 = J($\\theta$) + $λ$$||w||^1_1$, where $λ$ is another set of hyper-parameter that adjusts your L1 penality,   $||w||^1_1$ = $\\sum_{i=1}^N$ $|w_i|$ adds absolute value of magnitude as penality term to the loss function, $N$ denotes total number of layers.\n",
        "6. Whereas L2 is defined as follows: J($θ$)_2 = J($\\theta$) + $λ$$||w||^2_2$, where  $||w||^2_2$ = $\\sum_{i=1}^N$ $|w_i^2|$ adds squared magnitude as penality term to the loss function.\n",
        "6. Play with various optimizer such as Adam, RMSProp, Momentum\n",
        "4. Normalize your data within 0-1 range, create one-hot encoding for your labels.\n",
        "5. Take 3digit of your first name, and convert them based on character indices - For example: Ank ---> 1 14 11, so my seed is 11411. This will ensure each students have unique seeds.\n",
        "6. Run your experiments for minimum $20$ epochs. Remember one epoch is entire pass through data.\n",
        "7. You will run each experiment min $7$ times and report your average accuracy and standard error -- Change seed per trial\n",
        "8. We have provided 2 folders, members of Teams A - E will work on data that says Team_red and Team F- K will work on data that says Team_blue\n",
        "9. Important: All parameter optimization should be done on Validation/Dev set, you will only do one pass inference over test set.\n",
        "10. Complete all code blocks highlighted as TODO\n",
        "11. Sumbit your code, your report with findings and upload on canvas."
